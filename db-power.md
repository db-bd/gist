Here's a comparison of **how much data different databases can handle**, along with their typical use cases. Keep in mind, real-world performance depends heavily on **hardware, configuration, indexing, and schema design**, but databases often have **practical vs theoretical limits**.

### ðŸ”¢ **Comparison Table: Database Data Handling Capacity**

| Database                 | Data Handling Capacity (Theoretical / Practical)  | Notes / Use Cases                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **MySQL**                | TBs (up to \~256TB per table with InnoDB)         | Web apps, CMS, eCommerce              |
| **PostgreSQL**           | TBs (up to 32TB per table, unlimited rows)        | Data analytics, GIS, financial apps   |
| **MongoDB**              | PBs (max 64TB per document store theoretically)   | NoSQL, unstructured data, JSON-like   |
| **Redis**                | Depends on RAM (usually up to 1â€“2TB per instance) | In-memory cache, fast key-value store |
| **SQLite**               | \~281 TB (single .db file)                        | Embedded apps, mobile apps            |
| **MariaDB**              | Similar to MySQL (InnoDB â†’ up to 256TB/table)     | Same use cases as MySQL               |
| **Cassandra**            | PBs+ (horizontal scaling, billions of rows)       | Distributed, IoT, time-series data    |
| **ClickHouse**           | PBs (optimized for analytical queries)            | Real-time analytics, big data         |
| **TimescaleDB**          | TBs+ (built on PostgreSQL)                        | Time-series data, IoT, metrics        |
| **Elasticsearch**        | PBs+ (depends on sharding/indexing)               | Full-text search, logging, analytics  |
| **Oracle DB**            | TBsâ€“PBs (Exadata optimized for large systems)     | Enterprise-grade, mission-critical    |
| **MS SQL Server**        | TBs (524PB per database theoretically)            | Enterprise, BI, ERP systems           |
| **Neo4j (Graph DB)**     | TBs (limit depends on JVM and disk)               | Graph analytics, social networks      |
| **DynamoDB** (AWS)       | Unlimited (scales automatically)                  | Serverless NoSQL, event-driven apps   |
| **BigQuery / Snowflake** | Virtually Unlimited                               | Cloud data warehouses                 |

### ðŸ’¡ Notes

* **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Best for structured relational data, very mature, widely used.
* **MongoDB**: Great for flexible schemas and massive scale with horizontal sharding.
* **Redis**: Lightning fast, but all data must fit in memory unless using Redis-on-Flash or persistence.
* **SQLite**: File-based, great for apps or small-scale data; not recommended for very large systems.
* **Cassandra**: Ideal for massive write-heavy workloads and distributed environments.
* **ClickHouse / BigQuery / Snowflake**: Tailored for analytics at petabyte scale, not for frequent updates.

---

### ðŸš€ Scaling Up

* **Vertical Scaling**: Add more CPU/RAM/Storage to a single server (limited).
* **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more nodes (Cassandra, MongoDB, ClickHouse, etc. support this better).
